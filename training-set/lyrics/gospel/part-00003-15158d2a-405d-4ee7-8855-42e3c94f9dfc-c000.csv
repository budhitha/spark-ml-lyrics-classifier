The Williams Brothers,I'm Just a Nobody,1985,gospel,"I was walking downtown one day, And I saw a man that appeared to be just an old wino; Sitting on the streets, telling the people About Jesus as they passed by. And because he was all raggedy and dirty, People would just laugh and make fun Of the old man and walk on by. And he said because of the way I am, No money, no fancy clothes, no fine homes and cars, A lot of people consider me as nothing, And say I don't know what I am talking about. But there is one thing that he said That really touched my heart and stayed on my mind, When that old man looked up and said... I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody. I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody. And he said, I've had so many problems in my life, That I just couldn't deal with so I started drinking, Thought it would help ease my pain. But things got worse, so I said, 'Lord I give up I'm in your hands', And that's when my life began to change, But these people think I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody. And he said, On the streets day and night, That's my life, that's my home, Ain't got nowhere else I could go. So I just walk the streets, Telling the people about Jesus From corner to corner, from door to door; But they all make fun of me and say... I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody. Save, save, Save your soul. I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody."

Si todo fue por el calentón Tus ganas de verme el interior, yo de morderte el sujetador Mi amor, yo, párate, ¿para qué? Vente Desde mi tercero veo solo la gente Golpe de ginebra, licor, aguardiente Lo quiero lento, te veo impaciente Cielo, quiero comértelo hasta que nuble tu visión Quiero darte todo a cambio de tu caramelo Aunque yo no seré estrella Y tú no serás modelo, yo fui tu modelo a seguir Y tú la única estrella en mi cielo ¿Ves? Yo siempre vuelo y caigo Y, ¿cómo no prenderle fuego a to'? Mi vida, siempre vuelvo, siempre, siempre vuelvo y trago No todo es blanco y negro, recuerdo que había color Que el fuego calentaba y nada, al final me quemó Como todos me ven callado se piensan que juegan conmigo Sé de sobra que el camarero se hace pasar por mi amigo Es lo mismo que un camello, socialmente permitido Se ha nublado y me he doblado, y he acabado aquí metido Tengo adicciones muy cabronas Pero ninguna es como ver tus ojos poniéndose húmedos ¿A dónde me llevas? Me llena escuchar tu dolor Ten cuida'o, reina, el dinero solo son números Algún día, la droga va a dejar de ser tu follamiga Mirarás al cielo buscando una estrella invisible Cuando vivas senta'o en un sillón tragando medicinas Sabré que dejar de buscarnos era imposible Sé que querías guiarme estando perdida Que nos acariciábamos con lanzas encendidas Que lo apostamos todo y ahora debemos el triple"

The Williams Brothers,I'm Just a Nobody,1985,gospel,"I was walking downtown one day, And I saw a man that appeared to be just an old wino; Sitting on the streets, telling the people About Jesus as they passed by. And because he was all raggedy and dirty, People would just laugh and make fun Of the old man and walk on by. And he said because of the way I am, No money, no fancy clothes, no fine homes and cars, A lot of people consider me as nothing, And say I don't know what I am talking about. But there is one thing that he said That really touched my heart and stayed on my mind, When that old man looked up and said... I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody. I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody. And he said, I've had so many problems in my life, That I just couldn't deal with so I started drinking, Thought it would help ease my pain. But things got worse, so I said, 'Lord I give up I'm in your hands', And that's when my life began to change, But these people think I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody. And he said, On the streets day and night, That's my life, that's my home, Ain't got nowhere else I could go. So I just walk the streets, Telling the people about Jesus From corner to corner, from door to door; But they all make fun of me and say... I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody. Save, save, Save your soul. I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody, About somebody, who can save anybody."
